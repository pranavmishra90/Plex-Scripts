# This is a script which is for retention of video files on a Plex Server (DVR)
# The sample use case is retaining only the most recent news program (i.e. yesterday's news)

# The original script was designed to find all videos older than 10 hours and delete them. This would
# run daily at 6:30pm by a cron job. Essentially this was "delete all episodes older than 10 hours"

# The new script is designed to save the most recent video file. This allows for weekly programs with
# episodes older than 1 day, to be retained. Essentially this becomes "keep latest 1 episode"
